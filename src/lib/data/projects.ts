			`In this group project, I mainly worked on an internal software called DataSync, the Navigation Bar, login UI, login integrations and login captcha. The login feature and the DataSync project are shared across all websites they own. The internal tool DataSync was a tool built for the management of the company to be able to update information across all their websites and mobile applications without the need to code or have any tech knowledge. I was the head of the project and worked on the UI of the platform, created API endpoints on the backend with .NET, and setted up MongoDB databases to push information from the backend. As this is an internal tool of the company, I can't show it to the world, but I can show the Navigation Bar, login UI with the Google, Facebook and Apple integrations that I created and are shared across all websites this company owns, as well as the login captcha modal. https://dev.tykbroker.com/`,
